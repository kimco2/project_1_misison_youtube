## Below are the questions we explored and key findings for each.

## 1 -What categories trend most often?
* The top three categories with the greatest number of trending videos are Entertainment, Music and How to & Style.
* Entertainment has a substantially higher number of trending videos than any other category, with double the number of trending videos compared to the next highest category Music.
* Out of Top 5 trending videos based on views, 4 videos belong to “Music” categories and 1 videos belong to Entertainment categories.
* Out of Top 5 trending videos for the longest time, the video title 'Selena Gomez - Back To You (Lyric Video)' with category 'Film & Animation’ topped the list.


## 2 - Do different categories trend at times?
* Looking at the top five categories, Entertainment and Music continue to dominate, with the highest number of trending videos across all months.
* April and May are key months for trending videos, with the greatest number of trending videos for all of the top five categories.
* While March has the lowest number of trending videos for all categories.


## 3 - Does the day, time. month a video is publsihed impact on whether it trends?
* Videos published between 12pm to 11pm (more at 12pm  & 4pm) on a weekday, during May or the months of November to February trended for longer.

## 4 - Are trending videos a certain duration?
* Three quarters of trending videos are 9 minutes or less, with half having a duration of less than 5 minutes.
* Additionally, videos that trended for a longer period were under 4 minutes. 

## 5 - Is there any relationship between trending videos and likes/dislikes, views, comments, and tags?
* Highly viewed categories have a higher number of likes, and the relationship
between the two categories (Entertainment & Music) is strong. There was no relationship between the number of views and likes/dislikes for the other video categories. 
* The more tags a video has the fewer the number of dislikes.  Additionally, the more tags a video has the less comments it receives. For highly viewed videos, the number of tags does not have any relationship on the number of views.
* According to the correlations observed between the views and dislikes, it is recommended to the content producer to be cautious if publishing videos in controversial areas (such as Non-Profits & Activism and News & Politics) as these categories are prone to dislikes. 

## How Content Creators can optomise thier videos based on these findings...
* Publish videos in the entertainment or music categories - These categories have a the greatest number of trending videos.
* April and May have the greatest number of trending videos - Ensure your video is published in time to take advantage of this.  Also, don’t expect your video to trend in March, as it has the lowest number of trending videos.
* Consider when your publish your video (time, day month) - Publishing between 12pm to 11pm (more at 12pm  & 4pm) on a weekday, during May or the months of November to February will increase the length of days a video trends.
* Keep the video duration to under 9 minutes - Most trending videos are under 9 minutes, and half are less than 5 minutes.  To trend for a longer period keep the video under 4 minutes.
* Likes and views are related - Highly viewed categories have a higher number of likes and the relationship is strong.
* Be cautious if publishing videos in controversial areas - Content in controversial areas such as non-profits & activism and News & Politics are prone to dislikes.
* Tagification reduces dislikes - If you want to reduce the number of dislikes use a greater number of tags on your video.
