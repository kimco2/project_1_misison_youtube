Our purpose is to inform Content Creators how to optimise their videos based on those that are trending.

YouTube Trending Videos US 2017-2018 Dataset from Kaggle

Data exploration and Cleanup involved:
    US_cleaning_categories.ipynb


Analysis involved exploring these 5 questions.

1. Which categories trend most often?                                                       
        See US_youtube_categories.ipynb
        Using the cleaned_us_data.csv generated an array of the unique category IDs.
        Used the {}US_category_id.json to identify the name of each category ID.
        Added a column to cleaned_us_data.csv with the category name associated with each ID.

2. What types of videos are trending multiple times?
        US_cleaning_categories_.ipynb
        
3. Does the day, time, month a video is published impact on whether it trends?
        See US_youtube_release_time_day.ipynb
        See Objective 3 copy 2.md for a description of findings.
        See <ImagesObj3> folder for summary statistic tables and visualisations.
        See Youtube.ipynb for use of APi for duration of videos
 
4. Are trending videos a certain duration?
        See video_duration_data.ipynb for code and graphs
        Graphs are also saved in the output folder
          
5. Is there any relationship between trending videos and likes/dislikes, views, comments, and tags?

The implications of our findings for each of the 5 questions include:

Question 1.     Publish videos in the entertainment or music categories.
                These categories have a the greatest number of trending videos.

Question 2.     April and May have the greatest number of trending videos.
                Ensure your video is published in time to take advantage of this.
                Also, donâ€™t expect your video to trend in March, as it has the lowest number of trending videos.

Question 3.     Consider when your publish your video (time, day month).
                Publishing between 12pm to 11pm (more at 12pm  & 4pm) on a weekday, 
                during May or the months of November to February will increase the length of days a video trends.

Question 4.     Keep the video duration to under 9 minutes.
                Most trending videos are under 9 minutes, and half are less than 5 minutes.
                To trend for a longer period keep the video under 4 minutes.

Question 5.     Likes and views are related.
                Highly viewed categories have a higher number of likes and the relationship is strong.

                Be cautious if publishing videos in controversial areas.
                Content in controversial areas such as non-profits & activism and News & Politics are prone to dislikes.
                
                Tagification reduces dislikes.
                If you want to reduce the number of dislikes use a greater number of tags on your video.




Project Description/Outline

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new
- Data Story
- Insight: You Tube trends
- Inform: Content Creators on how to optimise their views based on trending categories and use of tags.
-  Excite
    
Research Questions to Answer
- Need to define what a trending video from the dataset means exactly
    
- Monthly trending categories.
   #The trending channel for each category.
   Movie vs Music
   Explore APIs for trending videos e.g. based on length of videos, time of day, day of the month that it is released and see if it is linked.
   How is the you tube channel monetised.
   What caused the you tube channel to tag it trending on the trending date.
   Does a video trend more than once across the selected period of time
    
- Comparison of most popular categories (describe) from publishing date to trending date per category to see how long it takes to trend.
   
- Which you tube channel has more views/likes/dislikes/comment-counts and correlate to see if any relationship.
   What videos are only liked or disliked.
   Do some categories get more likes/dislikes.
   
- Does a you tube channel tag number increase views/likes/comment_counts?
   Does tagification impact on viewing.
   Many to many relationship. Graph analysis.
   
   Link of category ID
